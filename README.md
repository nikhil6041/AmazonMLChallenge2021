# AmazonMLChallenge2021
This repo contains the solutions by team `Panaroma` for the Amazon ML challenge 2021.
We managed to fetch an overall team rank of 16th among 3000+ teams.
We have used multilingual BERT and did an end-to-end training for 3 epochs over the entire dataset after some preprocessing which involved removal of duplicates,handling missing values. We also tried XLM-Roberta for the given task. We managed to fetch 67.465 score on the public leaderboard through our approach.
